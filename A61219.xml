            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43734:2"/>that we cannot, or at leaſt we do not care to endure, or undergo any ſhort Pain or Puniſhment now; how much more intollerable muſt that then be which is Eternal? Who now think it ſo irkſome to tarry a few and evil Days here on Earth, although they have ſeveral good ones intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled? How can they endure to be in Hell for Thouſands and Millions of Years, without an Hour of Comfort or Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Miſery? Even now, although there are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of Sleep, and thoſe neceſſary and common Actions of Life, which divert from the Sence and Feeling thereof, yet ſtill a <hi>wounded and troubled Spirit who can bear?</hi> Much more may the Queſtion be asked, Can thine Heart endure under the gnawing of the Worm which ſhall never die? To whom every leaſt ſpark of Fire that falls upon any part of the Body is ſo painful, Can thine Hands be ſtrong? or how can they abide to lie down in Everlaſting Fire? Or how can they reſt in a Cradle of Flames? Or to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed in that <hi>Fire, which the Breath of the Lord like a ſtream of Brimſtone doth kindle.</hi> It is as bad, as bad can be: For lay together all the Evils, Pains, Torments, Fears, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, Afflictions, Croſſes; and ſuch like, which are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Earth, and they do not make up the ten thouſandth part ſo bad as the Damnation of Hell.</p>
               <p>It will be one of the Torments of Hell to be depriv'd not only from the Beatifical Viſion, but even from the ſight of the Heavens of God, (<hi>Perſecute and deſtroy them in Anger from under the Heavens of the Lord,</hi> Lam. 3.66.) which muſt needs be very melancholy and uncomfortable, not ſo much as to ſee the outſide of that place, where Bleſſedneſs dwells. For if one ſhould be kept in a very low Pit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Light or Company: What a reſtleſs thing would this be; or as they <hi>took Jeremiah, and cast him down into the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon that was in the Court of the Priſon; and they let down</hi> Jeremiah <hi>with Cords; and in the Dungeon there was no Water but Mire; ſo</hi> Jeremiah <hi>ſunk in the Mire,</hi> Jer. 38.6. Here were Sufferings indeed, which would make ones Heart ake to thoroughly think of it; much more would it fill the Soul with Anguiſh and Reſtleſneſs to undergo it. And what is it to be in a Dungeon for a few Days or Years, in compariſon to be in the loweſt Hell for all Eternity? The other is Light, and as nothing in compariſon unto it.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:43734:2"/>
               <p>As to all the Devices and Places of Torment, Vexation and Miſery, which People now uſe one to another; all theſe are but Inſtruments in the Hands of God, who <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Waſter to deſtroy,</hi> and made all thoſe Places and Things, which are now uſed for Pain and Puniſhment: And if he hath created ſuch on this Earth, as we ſenſibly know and ſee; much more hath he created alike Things under the Earth, and in Hell beneath: <hi>He is the great law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, who is able to ſave, and to deſtroy:</hi> As he doth Good, ſo likewiſe he can, and doth puniſh. There are on this Earth ſome things, which are very grievous and irkſome; but as long as there is Life, even in the worſt Evils that befall the Children of Men; there is no ſuch thing as perfect, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and compleat Miſery; I mean ſuch Miſery as is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Good or Comfort. There is no ſuch thing on Earth as <hi>utter Darkneſs,</hi> or the <hi>Blackneſs of Darkneſs;</hi> for in the moſt cloudy and miſty Night ſome little of Light may be ſtill perceived, eſpecially if you look up towards Heaven. Again, on this Earth all things are ſhort, and paſſing away: But in Hell it is perfect, compleat, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Miſery: That is, It is Miſery wholly, throughout, and nothing but Miſery. <hi>The Egyptians had for three Days ſuch Darkneſs which may be felt, even thick Darkneſs,</hi> Exod. 10.21, 22, 23. But in Hell there is utter Darkneſs, <hi>cast the unprofitable Servant into utter Darkneſs, and the Blackneſs of Darkneſs for ever.</hi> Which word <hi>for ever</hi> is the greateſt Sting and Aggravation of the Torment and Puniſhment hereof; for herein it infinitely exceeds, and is worſe than all the Evils and Pains on this Earth, and of this State; for whereas they all paſs away, either they go off again from the Sufferer, or elſe they make an end of the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſo as to kill him; and render him in ſuch a Condition, that he becomes paſt feeling thereof. It will be otherwiſe as to Hell; for there, <hi>if the Spirit ſhould fail before him, and the Souls which he hath made,</hi> yet they are kept alive, ſtill to undergo and endure the Severity of God's Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. It is called Death, the <hi>Second Death;</hi> for it is a State of ever dying, and never dead. <hi>In that Day ſhall Men ſeek Death, and it ſhall flee from them.</hi> Now Death is the worſt and moſt terrible thing in the World; for all other things are ſo much the more feared, as they may the ſooner oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43734:3"/>or bring on this thing of Death; But the <hi>ſecond Death,</hi> or <hi>Death Eternal,</hi> is indeed worſe than any Tongue of Man can expreſs forth. I cannot pencil forth Shadows dark enough to ſet forth the utmoſt Horror and Miſery thereof. The Lord preſerve every one that will be ſure to comply, and to work together with his Grace from doing thoſe things; the end whereof is <hi>Death Eternal:</hi> So that the Reader may not know and feel how bad indeed it is. One ſaith well, <hi>Let us not flee from Sermons of Hell, that we may flee from Hell;</hi> and by that manner of Speech of <hi>John Baptist,</hi> who hath warned you <hi>to flee from the wrath to come,</hi> Mat. 3.7. We learn that it is a great part of the Miniſterial Office and Duty, to warn People, that they flee from, and avoid, and uſe all Care and Diligence, leſt they fall into Hell, and <hi>to teſtifie unto them, leſt they come to the place of Torment,</hi> Luk. 16.28. Accordingly I do take ſuch to record, who ſhall Hear or Read this, that they do ceaſe and abſtain from all Appearance of Evil, and be ſure not to do thoſe things, to which this ſame future Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is annexed and threatned. We are told, that <hi>the Sinners of</hi> Zion <hi>are afraid; fearfulneſs hath ſurprized the Hypocrites; who among us ſhall dwell with devouring Fire? who amongst us ſhall dwell with Everlasting Burnings,</hi> Iſa. 33.14. <hi>They that do Iniquity ſhall be cast into a Furnace of Fire,</hi> Mat. 13.41, 42. <hi>The wrath of God cometh on the Children of Diſobedience,</hi> Col. 3.6. ſo that the Conſequence is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Certain, and Neceſſary, That if we would not dwell with devouring Fire, and with Everlaſting Burnings, nor yet be caſt into a Furnace of Fire, nor yet fall under the Wrath of God; we muſt be ſure to avoid all theſe four Things, <hi>Sin, Hypocriſie, Iniquity</hi> and <hi>Diſobedience;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, in order to eſcape Hell, ſet forth by all theſe kinds of Expreſſion; we muſt avoid Apoſtacy, or falling away, which I ground from this following Scripture: <hi>For if we ſin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for Sins; but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fearful looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation, which ſhall devour the Adverſaries,</hi> Heb. 10.25, 26.</p>
               <p>As we here ſee and know what we muſt avoid and eſchew in order to eſcape from everlaſting Puniſhment, (I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them over again for more abundant Safety and Care)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43734:3"/>It is <hi>Sin, Hypocriſie, Iniquity,</hi> (which ſignifies doing thoſe things that are not equal) <hi>Diſobedience, Apoſtacy,</hi> or <hi>Falling away.</hi> So on the other hand, we are ſhewed from out of the ſame Scriptures of Truth, what we are to do to obtain Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life; <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandments,</hi> Mat. 19.17. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have Right unto the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the Gates into the City,</hi> Rev. 22.14. Or, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>The Righteous ſhall go into life eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is a Comprehenſive Word, and ſignifies a Conformity to all the Words of Gods Law in Scripture. <hi>And it ſhall be our Righteouſneſs, if we obſerve to do all theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments before the Lord our God. as he hath commanded us, Deut.</hi> 6.25. And as <hi>Sin, Hypocriſie, Iniquity</hi> and <hi>Diſobedience</hi> do lead towards Hell, ſo this thing of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> (through God's gracious acceptation thereof,) furthers towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs whereof is called <hi>Life E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</hi> Now there can be nothing better, and more deſirable than Life. For by Life we receive, feel, and are rendred capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to enjoy all other things which can be had by Man. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, the Word of God which matle Man, and the Spirit of God which knows what is in Man, do ſo expreſs it. For by Life at firſt he is enabled to perceive Peace, Joy, Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and all thoſe Good things. Said Jeſus Chriſt.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43734:4"/>from that ſhort and empty meaſure thereof, we have ſome times here, when the end of our Joy is Grief, and there is a mixture of Heavineſs even in the midſt of it. <hi>And at thy right hand there are pleaſures for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 16.11. Which is a great and remarkable diverſity from thoſe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and periſhing Pleaſures here. It is called <hi>Everlasting Joy,</hi> Iſa. 35.10. whereas all Joy here is but for a Moment, and for the preſent time. It is called <hi>pure Gold,</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to that mixture of Droſs which is with it here. And <hi>Perfect Peace,</hi> Iſa. 26.3. To diſtinguiſh it again from that broken and interrupted Peace here. This Life is but Vain, and as a Vapour and continueth not; But the future Life is ſo ſubſtantial and enduring that it ſhall have no End. Whatever we meet with here which is delightful or pleaſing, yet ſtill we ſhould <hi>Prefer Jeruſalem above our chief Joy,</hi> Pſal. 137.6. So this ſhould be the only Standard or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of all our Comfort or Vexation, as it furthers or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the way to Heaven. So we ſhould be contented or pleaſed therewith, and give God thanks for the ſame. As again, when it hinders or obſtructs, or ſtops up the way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our going or Arriving there, this ſhould be Grief and Vexation of Spirit. And we ſhould endeavour as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it as we can. Truly, mine own eaſineſs or uneaſineſs of mind, doth wholly depend and turn upon this Point. As I do any thing which ſets me one ſtep forward in the way to Heaven, which I know aſſuredly from the Word of Truth (which ſhews and makes known the way of Life) as alſo from the approbation of mine own Conſcience, being guided thereby; herein I rejoyce, and give God thanks on this behalf.</p>
               <p>Again, It is unexpreſſible anguiſh and vexation of Soul, when any thing happens which turns me backward, or ſets me out of the right way. Which again I know by the very ſame manner as I do the other, by its being againſt the Scriptures; as alſo, I find thereupon mine own thoughts accuſing me, even a ſenſible Regret and Condemnation. <hi>Notwithſtanding in this rejoyce not, that the Spirits are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto you,</hi> (which yet is a good cauſe of rejoycing, for thoſe Spirits do very much lett, reſiſt and hinder, in our doing the Will of God) <hi>but rather rejoyce, becauſe your Names are written in Heaven,</hi> Luke 10 20. For by your Names being enrolled there, you are much more ſure of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43734:4"/>coming to Heaven from the Decree of God, than the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits can poſſibly hinder. And ſo the ſame Reaſoning is, Whatever your worldly Priviledges and Advantages are, whether thou haſt Riches, or reſpect from Men, whether thou haſt Wiſdom; Beauty, Health, or whatever is now uſually deſir'd, or eſteem'd by the Children of Men. In this rejoyce not, but rather rejoyce, becauſe thou haſt a well grounded Hope to go to Heaven, becauſe the Promiſes do belong to thee, and thou art within the Covenant, and alſo to thee pertaineth the Adoption inaſmuch as thou art ſo long a Son and Servant of God, as thou doſt his Will, and obeyeſt his Commands. The Scripture doth make known the place of Heaven, and alſo the way which each one muſt walk in, if he would arrive at, and enter therein, <hi>viz.</hi> by keeping the Commandments of God, which are written and recorded in that ſame Book.</p>
               <p>The People of old time, and of former Generations, did talk and preach of the things pertaining to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, after the ſame manner as we do now. Such as were his Saints and Children did <hi>live by Faith,</hi> Hab. 2.4. and <hi>died in Faith; Not having received the Promiſes, but having ſeen them afar off, and were perſuaded of them, and embraced them,</hi> Heb. 11.13. And even the ignorant and ungodly Multitude of former Generations, have alſo paſſed through the Door, or Gate and Entrance into the inviſible World: I mean Death. And as the <hi>Devils believe and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> And as the Souls of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> do at this Day live; ſo their Souls alſo live and exiſt, and they have a more clear knowledge and apprehenſion of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God concerning Mankind than they had, or we have in the days of our Fleſh, ſo that in them who ſin wilfully, what was formerly Ignorance or Unbelief, is now a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fearful looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſhall devour them for having been God's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. But ſuch as in the Days of their Fleſh were <hi>willing</hi> and <hi>obedient,</hi> they <hi>ſhall eat the good of the Land,</hi> Iſa. 1.19. even of the new Heavens and new Earth, where Righteouſneſs dwells. And as thoſe who did <hi>refuſe</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> ſhall have a certain fearful looking for of Judgment, ſo unto the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright there ariſeth Light in the Darkneſs,</hi> even after they are paſſed the darkneſs of the ſhadow of Death, and they have a comfortable expectation of good things
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43734:5"/>to come. The Children of Men will then remember how that the Sinners, and Ungodly, and merry Men of the World, did in their life time receive their good things, that is, they received their <hi>Portion in this Life,</hi> Pſal. 17.14. <hi>Becauſe by them their Portion is fat, and their Meat plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> Hab. 1.16. And the Godly and Righteous received evil things, Perſecutions, Afflictions, Poverty, <hi>but now they are comforted, and the others are tormented,</hi> Luke 16.25. As is the condition of thoſe who are already gone off from the Stage of this Earth, ſo will ours be in a ſhort time; they are dead, and we are dying.</p>
               <p>As for my part I was young, and now am elderly, tho not old, and I am fearful and apprehenſive every Week of taſting of this bitterneſs of Death. But I do yet more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly fear and quake, leſt my Soul ſhould be ſhut un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Harches by Death, before I have a better and more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Hope whither it would go. As it is written, <hi>Gather not my Soul with Sinners,</hi> Pſal. 26.9. So it is the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Deſire and Prayer of my Soul, as the ſame ſhould be my utmoſt endeavour throughout this life. O Lord, our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, the Inviſible One, when this Body muſt return to the Earth as it was, and the Spirit to God that gave it, O then do Thou not gather my Soul with the Sinners and Tranſgreſſors of former Generations. Which Prayer as I did write down, and lift up my Soul unto God for the ſame, it was thereupon immediately anſwered, directed, and dictated unto me, That if thou wouldeſt not have thy Soul gathered with the Sinners and Tranſgreſſors of former Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, then thou muſt be ſure not to be one of their number; that is, thou muſt not be a Sinner and Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor in that Generation wherein thou now liveſt. But this is my Requeſt, and my coueting, and the thing that I long for, That the Lord would be pleaſed to bind up my Soul in the bundle of Life. Into thy Hands I commit my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for Thou haſt Redeemed me, O Lord God of Truth, that my Soul may be gathered up unto the Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and that when I do depart, or deceaſe from out of this Body, I may come unto Mount <hi>Sion, and to the City of the Living God, the heavenly Jeruſalem, and to an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Company of Angels, to the general Aſſembly and Church of the First-born, which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of Just Men made perfect.</hi>

                  <hi>My Fleſh and my Heart faileth; but God is the ſtrength of my Heart, and my Portion for ever,</hi> Pſal. 73.26. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this Fleſh doth fade as a Leaf, wax old like a Garment, and wither as a Stick, and it will not long hold the Soul in; and therefore againſt the time that this our Heart and our Fleſh faileth (yea, our Heart faileth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and before-hand at the thorough Thought and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion thereof). It muſt be our beſt and wiſeſt, and moſt excellent way to have God for the Strength of our Heart, and for our Portion for ever. That againſt the time this Tenement of Clay fails, by mouldering and falling down into the Duſt; He may take us unto his own Home, and receive us into Everlaſting Manſions, which are in our Father's Houſe. That as it is written, <hi>And ye ſhall go forth, and grow up as the Calves of the Stall,</hi> Mal. 4.2. So we may be fixed and ſeated in Stalls and Apartments of Glory. <hi>For the Lord's Portion is his People;</hi> Jacob <hi>is the lot of his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; He found him in a deſert Land, in the waſte howling Wilderneſs,</hi> Deut. 32.9, 10. This laſt is juſt like our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition now here on Earth, where God finds and culls out ſuch and ſuch of the Sons and Daughters of Men <hi>(the Lord knoweth them that are his)</hi> as are his People, and <hi>Jacob for the lot of his Inheritance.</hi> Now a Lot takes ſome, and leaves others, even a few, and ſingle ones from out of the Multitude: So of old time he took out <hi>Jacob</hi> for his peculiar People from the reſt of Mankind. <hi>Now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ſhall ye be a peculiar people unto me above all people, for all the earth is mine,</hi> Exod. 19.4. And ſo he doth at this day take out by Lot as it were his peculiar People from all Nations, Countrys, and Languages of Mankind, even only thoſe who obey his Voice indeed, and keep his Covenant. Both the Voice &amp; Covenant ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and manifeſted within them; as alſo what is written in Ink and Paper in the lively Oracles, the Book of the Lord, which we commonly call the Bible.</p>
               <p>There is a very great deal ſaid in the <hi>Old. Teſtament</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Heaven, Immortality, and Eternal Life; yea, much more then many People are aware of; for Heaven, Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and Eternal Life are there couched and comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under all thoſe ſeveral Expreſſions (which are repeated over innumerable times in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi>) <hi>The Lords portion is his people; the Lord,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43734:6"/>the hope of their fathers,</hi> Jer. 50.7. <hi>Happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 144.15. <hi>Happy is he that hath the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>for his help, whoſe hope is in the Lord his God,</hi> Pſal. 146.5. And by all ſuch Phraſes and Forms of Speech there, which the Holy Ghoſt makes uſe of, to ſhew that ſuch of his Creatures as ſerve and obey him, they have alſo an Intereſt and Propriety in him. He is <hi>their God,</hi> or <hi>my God,</hi> or ſuch like. In all theſe as under a Vail is contained Heaven, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and Eternal Life. For there is a way of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly gathering and reaſoning out of the Scriptures, to bring out ſuch and ſuch Truths, although they ſeem to ſpeak nothing thereof in plain and expreſs Words. Even ſo it is here, for by the ſame way of aſſuredly gathering and reaſoning out of the Scriptures as is uſed in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. <hi>He was not aſhamed to be called their God,</hi> (ſo far goes the Text there cited out of the <hi>Old-Teſtament,</hi> but then ſaith the Reaſoning by the Spirit further) <hi>for he hath prepared for them a City.</hi> From this very place we lay down and eſtabliſh that grand Poſition and Affirmation, which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, That where-ever in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> God is ſaid to be their God, therein is contained the Promiſe of Heaven, Immortality, and Eternal Life; this being <hi>that City which he hath prepared for them.</hi> And to make this Matter a little more plain and clear, the Reaſon hereof ſtands on this wiſe, <hi>He is not aſhamed to be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a City.</hi> That is, They had Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Aſſurance that God would do ſomewhat more for his Servants than Temporal and preſent Mercies, for they were alſo common unto others: But as he is juſt and good, ſo he would make ſome Requital for Obedience, and for that Hardſhip and Inconvenience his Servants meet with from the World for his ſake, which they did expect here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in another place, and that is Heaven; and alſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould remain, or elſe be raiſed up again into a State capable to receive and partake of that great Good God had prepared for his Creatures, which muſt be by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or giving them Life again. For they were ſenſibly bereaved of this preſent Life, and here they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, by reaſon of Death: So that of Neceſſity therein muſt virtually be contained the Promiſe of Immortality and Eternal Life; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith appoſitely and pertinently to the Matter here treated of, in <hi>Hope of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43734:6"/>Life, which God, that cannot lie promiſed before the World began; but hath in due time manifeſted his Word through preaching,</hi> Tit. 1.2. for diſcovery hath been made thereof by little and little. It was contained in thoſe general Expreſſions afore-mentioned; <hi>the Lord their God, I am the God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, and Jacob,</hi> and ſuch like. God was the ſame then, and his Decrees alike ſure, although they were not ſo clearly made known unto Men. And therefore now it is called Hope, <hi>which entreth into that within the vail,</hi> Heb. 6.19. <hi>a better hope,</hi> Heb. 7.19. <hi>a lively hope,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. all in oppoſition to thoſe faint Gueſſes, and imperfect Knowledge they had thereof under the Law. It is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plainly under the Goſpel, according to <hi>John</hi> 16.25. in oppoſition to thoſe <hi>dark Speeches,</hi> which God ſpake by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or thoſe Parables and Proverbs, which he ſpake by his Servants, the Prophets. They under the <hi>Old-Teſtament</hi> Diſpenſation had but a dull and glimmering Proſpect beyond the Earthly <hi>Canaan:</hi> But now the appearing of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt <hi>hath aboliſhed Death, and hath brought Life and Immortality to light thro' the Goſpel,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.10.</p>
               <p>And tho in the Goſpel it is ſpoken more plainly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heaven, Immortality, and Eternal Life, and alſo more ſuitable unto our Carnal Apprehenſions, and Fleſhly Mind, in deſcribing it by the outward Repreſentations of a Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Supper, Gold, Honour, Pleaſure, Satisfaction, Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſuch like; yet there is alſo ſomewhat ſpoken of theſe things in the <hi>Old-Teſtament:</hi> But all that, and much more than all that, is comprehended under that one ſaying; <hi>The Lord our God, the Lord is my Portion for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps the Hearer or Reader may expect, that now I am a diſcourſing of the Happineſs of Heaven; here I ſhould be unto thee as a <hi>very lovely Song of one that hath a pleaſant Voice, and can play well on an Inſtrument,</hi> Ezek. 33.32. This being ſo very delightful a Subject; that if here thou canſt not tickle the Ear, and pleaſe thy Auditory, thou never wilt.</p>
               <p>But now ſuppoſe I ſhould here uſe Ten Thouſand Words in Rhetorical Flouriſhes, in the greateſt Eloquency, and Wit of Man, with the moſt ſmooth Language, with the greateſt Connexion, and Exactneſs of Stile, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this beſt of Subjects, the Happineſs or Joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yet as it is ſaid, <hi>That ſhe who caſt her two mites into the

               <p>This will alſo further appear from this following ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy and Reaſoning, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Lord is our God, or if the Lord is my Strength, and my Portion for ever, thence it follows alſo of conſequence, That all that Bleſſedneſs, Happineſs, Goodneſs, Delight, Satisfaction and Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is in God the Everlaſting Creator of the Ends of the Earth, (as it is all in him, which is any where in the World; for they are all but Rays and Emanations from this infinite Fountain of Life and Being;) I ſay, all theſe are communicated, and imparted forth, (even as far as the ſmall Veſſel is capable to receive brimfull, and running over) to ſuch of his Creatures and People, to whom he is the Lord their God, and they are his Portion, and the Lot of his Inheritance, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There is but one thing in the World which hinders all the reaſonable Creatures on the Earth, from this Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Union with their God, and that is Sin. .

As the foregoing part of the Verſe doth illuſtrate and ſhew that, ſo by the latter part of the Verſe, the Holy Ghoſt doth ſignifie, that ſuch of his Creatures as ſhall then be more nearly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in the Preſence of God (where is fulneſs of Joy, and at whoſe Right Hand are Pleaſures for evermore;) all Refreſhing, Content, Satisfaction, yea, and Happineſs doth ariſe from him; as Waters do flow from the Fountain, Light doth proceed from the Sun, or as Heat doth iſſue forth from Burning Fire to the things that are next unto it.</p>
               <p>As on the foregoing part of our Being he is our Creator, and he is our Preſerver in the mean while, who holds our Soul in Life all the time that it is in the Body; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards alſo he that firſt breathed into us the Breath of Life,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43734:7"/>can, and alſo doth preſerve it when it is gone forth: So in his being our Portion for ever, he will take Care of and do good for us in the time to come, and throughout the ſucceeding Eternity. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto God ſhall all fleſh come,</hi> Pſ. 65.2. that is, good and bad promiſcuouſly to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in judgment; but <hi>unto him ſhall the gathering of the People be,</hi> Gen. 49.10. This in a particular manner is meant of his own particular Elect, Redeemed and Choſen People, who in this Life, and on this Earth do gather, and make towards God by Faith and Obedience, by Love, Truſt, and Adherence; and hereafter they ſhall flow back unto (as Rivers again to the Sea, from whence they did firſt ariſe) and be admitted into his immediate Preſence to the neareſt Communion, and cloſeſt Union with the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head himſelf. He will gather all Souls which are his, which he hath made, and which he hath redeemed, that is from Sin here, and from Death and the Devil hereafter, as nearly, and as cloſely to himſelf, as a <hi>Hen doth gather her Chickens under her Wings.</hi> It is ſomewhat too groſs an Expreſſion to ſay, that the Souls of the Righteous ſhall be incorporated with the Deity, for that denotes ſomewhat too material a Conception of ſuch Spiritual and Immaterial things. But the Union will be as near, and as cloſe as what is ingrafted into ſuch a Stock, is near and cloſe to the ſame ſtock, and it becomes as one, and the ſame with it. <hi>And the nations of them that be ſaved, ſhall walk in the light of it,</hi> Rev. 21.24. But this is not all; for further, they ſhall be one, and as it were the ſame with God himſelf. <hi>Holy Father keep thorough thine own Name thoſe whom then haſt given me, that they may be one as we are: And now I come to thee, that they may be all in one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us,</hi> Joh. 17.11, 13, 21. This being one, and as it were the ſame with God, (who ſhall then be all in all, but the Creatures have and derive it from him by Union and participation) will be the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and greateſt, and only Happineſs in Heaven. The Truth whereof may be hence underſtood, for God is a moſt happy Being: For he created all Happineſs and Good, and he is comprehenſive of all Happineſs and Good; ſo that all Happineſs and Good do reſide and lodge in him, as in their Foundation Stock or Fountain; from whence do flow forth all Derivations and Emanations of Good and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43734:8"/>So as when any one is nearer to the Sun, he is nearer to the Light and Heat; ſo the Nations and Perſons of thoſe who are ſaved, who are nearer to God, are alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by nearer to Good and Happineſs.

And as Chriſt himſelf doth promiſe, <hi>Where I am there ſhall my ſervant be; if any man ſerve me, him will my father honour,</hi> John 11.26. <hi>That they may be all one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee; that they alſo may be one in us. And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one,</hi> John 17.22, 23. which Prayer of Chriſt is heard and granted; accordingly he elſewhere calls him, <hi>My Father and your Father, my God and your God,</hi> Joh. 20.17. By expreſſing of which, on this wiſe he ſhews himſelf to be the firſt born of many Brethren, that Chriſt in all things ſhould have the Pre-eminence: But from all this put together, it may be moſt ſurely Argued and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, that if Chriſt be the Son of the bleſſed, then they that are Chriſt's, are the Sons of the Bleſſed; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Scripture doth elſewhere expreſly averr the ſame, <hi>Behold, now are we the ſons of God,</hi> 1 John 3.2. and if they are the Sons of the Bleſſed, <hi>then we know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> This Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng out of the Scriptures is right preaching, for ſo did <hi>Paul</hi> reaſon out of the Scriptures concerning ſeveral things; and ſo are we allowed to bring out all thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Truths, relating to the Kingdom of God, and man's Salvation.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43734:8"/>is by Holineſs, becauſe of what is ſaid in this ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> ver. 24. who have not Holineſs here, that man or Woman will not have Happineſs or Bleſſedneſs hereafter.</p>
               <p>Concerning this future and everlaſting Happineſs of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, many things do ariſe in the Mind which are hard to be uttered, and hard to be conceived. For ſince <hi>the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World, Men have not heard non perceived by the heart, neither hath the Eye ſeen, O God, beſides thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him,</hi> Iſa. 64.4. (As we do this Day in this Ordinance of Hearing his word) or that love him. But <hi>God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.</hi> Which ſame Spirit ſpake by the Prophets, Chriſt and the Apoſtles, out of whoſe Words and Writings this ſame deſcription of Heaven, and the Joys thereof, hath been brought forth.</p>
               <p>And what ſhall I ſay more? where I begun and found it, there I muſt leave it. If I ſhould multiply never ſo many Words, I cannot ſay more than what I have ſaid already, That the whole of Heaven, and the Happineſs thereof, is compriſed in theſe very few Words, <hi>The Lord our God, the Lord is the strength of my heart, and my Portion for ever.</hi> Or in the Language of the Goſpel. <hi>We</hi> (that is, only his Elect) <hi>ſhall ever be with the Lord,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.17. If you ſet aſide theſe kind of Expreſſions, and then if you Read, or Hear never ſo much concerning Heaven; yet when you come there, you will affirm, as the Queen of <hi>Sbeba</hi> did of the Wiſdom of <hi>Solomon, The one half was not told me.</hi> But if you once add and mention, <hi>The Lord ſhall be my Portion for ever:</hi> Or, <hi>We ſhall ever be with the Lord,</hi> therein the whole and utmoſt of Heaven was told unto thee before hand, and the Souls of ſuch as ſhall be Saved, and admitted there, will make their return, <hi>As we have heard, ſo have we ſeen, in the City of the Lord, of Hoſts, in the City of our God, God will Eſtabliſh it for ever.</hi> Selah. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.8.</p>
               <p>When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. doth mention how <hi>we ſhall ever be with the Lord;</hi> He thereupon immediately annexes and ſubjoyns, Wherefore comfort (in the Marginal Reading, there it is exhort) <hi>One another with theſe Words.</hi> And as it is here ſaid, <hi>God will eſtabliſh it</hi> (that is, the City he hath prepared for his People, <hi>for ever Selah.</hi> So it is Meet and Right, that by the way of Retaliation and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good Will, (<hi>Paul</hi> Calls it a <hi>Good Mind</hi> towards God)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43734:9"/>this little while that we are in the way, that his Servants and their Seed ſhould be eſtabliſhed before him, in his Worſhip and Service, in finiſhing his Work and doing his Will. They ſhould be ſettled, fixed and rooted herein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life,</hi> Rev. 2.10. But <hi>he that ſhall endure unto the end the ſame ſhall be ſaved;</hi> Mat. 24.13. Hereby alſo People will be enabled in this World of Tryal and Temptation, to chuſe <hi>rather to ſuffer affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; esteeming the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Chriſt greater Riches than the Treaſures of</hi> Egypt. For he had <hi>reſpect unto the recompence of reward,</hi> Heb. 11.25, 26. So they will go through the courſe (of what is imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the dulneſs, irkſomneſs, and tediouſneſs of a Religious Life, which indeed is real Peace and Satisfaction to the Heart of Man, to ſuch who univerſally comply and conform unto it all along, although the World, and Strangers to this Joy, and alſo our fleſhly corrupt Nature are apt to call it ſo) rather than to enjoy the outward Mirth, Recreations and Pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon, knowing that all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and Inconveniencies which we meet withal, for holding and continuing in this our good way, <hi>are greater. Riches than the Treaſures of the World, for we have reſpect unto the recompence of reward.</hi> Keep an Eye ſtill to that, and this will prevent that we wax not weary in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for we ſhall reap, in due ſeaſon, if we faint not. Whileſt, let others do what they will, we do all along fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, propoſe and endeavour after an end which is worthy, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſerve God here with all our Mind, Body, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate that we may enjoy Him hereafter, and ſo <hi>ever be with the Lord, Amen.</hi>
